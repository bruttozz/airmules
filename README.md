# airmules
I am going to run my original project airmute stage, which is aiming to take full advantage of the free space in your luggage while you take international flights.

Please follow my wechat service account: airmules, thank you.
I am happy to declare our domain is airmules.net which was registered on AWS!
The website is under struction now with WordPress.
We are going to use MySQL as our database to store users' information.
